# TensorLight
TensorLight is a light-weight tensor operation library for C with broadcasting support.

## Prerequisites
The following steps have been tested for Ubuntu 16.04 but should work with
other distros as well. 
Required packages can be installed using the following command:

```
sudo apt-get install build-essential perl git pkg-config check
```

### ESP32 Cross-Compilation
To cross-compile for ESP32, you need the ESP32 toolchain installed. You can install it by:

1. Installing ESP-IDF: Follow the instructions at [ESP-IDF Programming Guide](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/get-started/index.html)
2. Ensuring the ESP32 toolchain is in your PATH or specify its directory with the `--esp32-toolchain-dir` option

### Docker Testing Environment
For consistent testing across different environments, you can use the provided Docker setup:

1. Make sure you have Docker installed on your system
2. Run the provided script to build and test in a Docker container:
   ```
   ./run-tests-docker.sh
   ```

This will create an Ubuntu 22.04 container with all required dependencies and run the tests inside it. See the [Docker documentation](docker/README.md) for more information.

## Building and Installation
1.  Clone this repository to your local directory.

    ```
    cd <my_working_directory>
    git clone https://github.com/zhaozhixu/TensorLight.git
    cd TensorLight
    ```

2.  Build and install

    First, configure your installation using:
    
    ```
    chmod +x configure
    ./configure
    ```
    There are options to customize your building and installation process.
    You can append them after `./configure`. 
    
    For cross-compiling for ESP32:
    ```
    ./configure --esp32=yes
    ```
    
    Or if your ESP32 toolchain is not in your PATH:
    ```
    ./configure --esp32=yes --esp32-toolchain-dir=/path/to/esp-idf/tools/xtensa-esp32-elf
    ```
    
    Detailed `./configure` options can be printed using `./configure -h`.

    After that, use `make` to compile the library and run the tests. Then `make install`
    to copy the library files and headers into the installation directory,
    or `sudo make install` if you don't have the permissions with that directory.
    
    ```
    make
    sudo make install
    ```

3.  Other `make` options

    Use `make info` to see other `make` options.
    Especially, you can use `make clean` to clean up the build directory and all
    object files, and `make uninstall` to remove library files and headers from
    the installation directory.

## Usage
Include `tl_tensor.h` in your project to use TensorLight functions.

You can use the following command to get the compilation and linking flags when
building your project.

```
pkg-config --cflags --libs tensorlight
```

## Broadcasting Support

TensorLight now supports broadcasting operations similar to NumPy. Broadcasting allows you to perform operations on arrays of different shapes. The rules for broadcasting are:

1. Arrays with fewer dimensions are prepended with dimensions of size 1.
2. Size-1 dimensions are stretched to match the corresponding dimension of the other array.
3. Arrays must be broadcastable in each dimension (they must have the same size, or one of them must have size 1).

### Broadcasting API

```c
// Check if two tensors can be broadcast together
int tl_tensor_isbroadcastable(const tl_tensor *t1, const tl_tensor *t2);

// Broadcast a tensor to a new shape
tl_tensor *tl_tensor_broadcast_to(const tl_tensor *src, tl_tensor *dst, int ndim, const int *dims);

// Element-wise operation with broadcasting
tl_tensor *tl_tensor_elew_broadcast(const tl_tensor *src1, const tl_tensor *src2, tl_tensor *dst, tl_elew_op elew_op);
```

### Broadcasting Examples

```c
// Example 1: Broadcasting a scalar to a matrix
float scalar_val = 5.0f;
tl_tensor *scalar = tl_tensor_create(&scalar_val, 1, (int[]){1}, TL_FLOAT);
tl_tensor *result = tl_tensor_broadcast_to(scalar, NULL, 2, (int[]){3, 4});
// result will be a 3Ã—4 matrix filled with 5.0

// Example 2: Element-wise multiplication with broadcasting
float arr1[] = {1, 2, 3};  // Shape: [3]
float arr2[] = {10, 20};   // Shape: [2, 1]
tl_tensor *t1 = tl_tensor_create(arr1, 1, (int[]){3}, TL_FLOAT);
tl_tensor *t2 = tl_tensor_create(arr2, 2, (int[]){2, 1}, TL_FLOAT);
tl_tensor *result = tl_tensor_elew_broadcast(t1, t2, NULL, TL_MUL);
// result will have shape [2, 3] and values [[10, 20, 30], [20, 40, 60]]
```

Additional documentation is coming soon. But the API should be familiar if you have experience with `numpy` in Python.
